# You may notice that no OperatorControl tasks have been
# added in this file. This is because they have been added
# within their moduals. For example in the drive.py file
# we have the class definition then under that we have an
# import for the scheduler object declared at the bottom
# of the scheduler.py file. Under the import we register
# the Drive.DriveTeleop() with the scheduler. This allows
# for us to keep the robot.py file pretty clean. for an
# operator control task to registered you just have to
# include the modual

# joystics added at the bottom of robotmap.py
