# You may notice that no OperatorControl tasks have been
# added in this file. This is because they have been added
# within their moduals. For example in the drive.py file
# we have the class definition then under that we have an
# import for the scheduler object declared at the bottom
# of the scheduler.py file. Under the import we register
# the Drive.DriveTeleop() with the scheduler. This allows 
# for us to keep the robot.py file pretty clean. for an
# operator control task to registered you just have to
# include the modual


# Import the wpilib, if it is not avaliable it will import 
# fake wpilib
from get_wpilib import wpilib

# Import the robot map to be able to access things like
# joystics added at the bottom of robotmap.py

# Import the instance of Scheduler called scheduler to be 
# able to use it.
from scheduler import scheduler

# Import the modules wich also registers the operator
# control tasks.
