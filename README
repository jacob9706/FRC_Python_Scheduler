class Scheduler(__builtin__.object)
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  Autonomous(self, debug=False)
 |      Call the registered autonomous tasks when their time has come.
 |      Will return True when all tasks have resolved otherwise False.
 |      
 |      See register_auto_task for an explanation of the diffrent kind of tasks.
 |  
 |  ClearAutonomousTasks(self)
 |      Remove all autonomous tasks from the scheduler.
 |  
 |  ClearOperatorControlTasks(self)
 |      Remove all operator control tasks form the scheduler.
 |  
 |  ListAutonomousTasks(self)
 |      List all the autonomous tasks in the console.
 |  
 |  ListOperatorControlTasks(self)
 |      List all operator control tasks in the console.
 |  
 |  OperatorControl(self, debug=False)
 |      Call all the registered teleop tasks once.
 |      This is meant to be called inside of a loop.
 |      Will return True when all tasks have resolved otherwise False.
 |  
 |  RegisterAutonomousTask(self, taskName, task, ttype='SEQUENTIAL_TASK', *params)
 |      Register an autonomous task to be executed in order they were added.
 |      Autonomous tasks can be either a SEQUENTIAL_TASK or a PARALLEL_TASK.
 |      
 |      A SEQUENTIAL_TASK will not be executed until all other sequential tasks
 |      added before have resolved (returned True). This allows for tasks to be
 |      schedualed in a "step by step" manner.
 |      
 |      A PARALLEL_TASK will run when it is reached and continue to run until it
 |      is resolved.
 |      
 |      Example:
 |      S = SEQUENTIAL_TASK
 |      P = PARALLEL_TASK
 |      
 |      S s1
 |      P p1
 |      S s2
 |      
 |      In this example s1 will be the only thing running until it has resolved. After
 |      it has resolved p1 and s2 will be run. if s2 resolves p1 will continue to run 
 |      until it has been resolved.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task.
 |      @task -- A callable function that must return True or False.
 |      @ttype -- The type of task (default SEQUENTIAL_TASK)
 |  
 |  RegisterAutonomousTaskIfNotAlready(self, taskName, task, ttype='SEQUENTIAL_TASK', *params)
 |      Register an autonomous task to be executed in order they were added.
 |      Autonomous tasks can be either a SEQUENTIAL_TASK or a PARALLEL_TASK.
 |      
 |      Unlike register_auto_task this method will check to see in a
 |      task of the name of the callable task is already registered. Not
 |      the taskName you give it but task.__name__. This means that if
 |      you register a Claw.teleop for one and try to register a Arm.teleop
 |      with this method the Arm.teleop will not be registered.
 |      
 |      A SEQUENTIAL_TASK will not be executed until all other sequential tasks
 |      added before have resolved (returned True). This allows for tasks to be
 |      schedualed in a "step by step" manner.
 |      
 |      A PARALLEL_TASK will run when it is reached and continue to run until it
 |      is resolved.
 |      
 |      Example:
 |      S = SEQUENTIAL_TASK
 |      P = PARALLEL_TASK
 |      
 |      S s1
 |      P p1
 |      S s2
 |      
 |      In this example s1 will be the only thing running until it has resolved. After
 |      it has resolved p1 and s2 will be run. if s2 resolves p1 will continue to run 
 |      until it has been resolved.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task.
 |      @task -- A callable function that must return True or False.
 |      @ttype -- The type of task (default SEQUENTIAL_TASK)
 |  
 |  RegisterOperatorControlTask(self, taskName, task, *params)
 |      Register a callable task to be called in the
 |      teleop_loop function. task must return True or
 |      False. Once the function returns True the function
 |      will be removed from the dictionary of tasks to
 |      be called in the teleop_loop.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task.
 |      @task -- A callable function that must return True or False.
 |  
 |  RegisterOperatorControlTaskIfNotAlready(self, taskName, task, *params)
 |      Register a callable task to be called in the
 |      teleop_loop function. task must return True or
 |      False. Once the function returns True the function
 |      will be removed from the dictionary of tasks to
 |      be called in the teleop_loop.
 |      
 |      Unlike register_teleop_task this method will check to see in a
 |      task of the name of the callable task is already registered. Not
 |      the taskName you give it but task.__name__. This means that if
 |      you register a Claw.teleop for one and try to register a Arm.teleop
 |      with this method the Arm.teleop will not be registered.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task.
 |      @task -- A callable function that must return True or False.
 |  
 |  RemoveAutonomousTask(self, taskName, debug=False)
 |      Remove a task based on a name. If the task is found and
 |      removed it will return True, else it will return False.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task to remove.
 |  
 |  RemoveOperatorControlTask(self, taskName, debug=False)
 |      Remove a task based on a name. If the task is found and
 |      removed it will return True, else it will return False.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @taskName -- The name of the task to remove.
 |  
 |  __init__(self, robot_name='')
 |      Initialize a Scheduler for maneging robot tasks.
 |      
 |      Keyword arguments:
 |      @robot_name -- The name of the robot.
